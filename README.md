## CrimeDashboard
This repository is built to download and process data related to crime and create a dashboard. We are going to look at crime data from specific cities and see how crime relates to demographic information such as income, population density, household size and other factors. We plan on collecting some of this demographic information using zip codes and joining this to the datasets that we have already found.
