 ### Team Evaluation

 Our team feels that we are working at a good pace to have our dashboard completed by the end of the semester. We have been using our class time to work on brainstorming ideas and obtaining our data. We think that in the future we could have challenges with technical issues. We have already had a few issues using git. We are also unsure of what problems we may face once we start to create our database. When these issues come up we will work together to try and find a solution and will ask for outside help if needed.


 ### Technology Plan

 We are using python for most processes. It will be used for downloading our data and the sqlite3 library will be used to host a database for cleaning and transforming data within the python program. We are planning on using power bi for a dashboard and are still looking into how that could work. From our research so far we think it should be possible to run our python script inside power bi and access the datasets, but we are still looking into the specifics of that process.  


 ### Data Wrangling
 
We are looking the crime data. We have the dataset of Arrests, homicides, and population. We also have the various features related to qualtity of life in each states. We have the dataset recidivism which says what percenatge of prisoner are incarcerated again after being released. We do have prison population and imprisoment rate. So far, we have set database and put the data into the database. We are working on transformation of the dataset. Some of the dataset are found in Json file which we need to convert it into csv file. 


 ### Project Goals
 
 Our project aims to investigate how crime rates and recidivism rates are influenced by various demographic and economic factors. Specifically, we seek to understand the relationship between population size, economic status, quality of life, and crime trends, using census and economic data to identify potential correlations. Our main question is: How are crime rates and recidivism rates affected by other demographic information? The intended audience for this research includes future classes studying crime and sociology, as well as a PSA that could help inform communities and policy makers.

 ### Exploratory Analysis

We are using the Power Bi,  pandas, Matplotlib for making visualization, Sklearn for good for modelling. There is the linear correlation between the different variables in the data.csv. There is  .62 correlation between imprisonment rate and recidivism rate or comparing the imprisonment rate to the quality of life scores. Again, this is only looking at linear correlations, so there may be stronger correlations that are not showing in this map because the data may be non-linear. I have encountered the issue in the dataset mainly in json dataset. We changed  json to css file. Imprisonment rate and Quality of lifeTotal scores are the important predictors of our dataset. We have seen the correlation between the varicose but we haven't discuss trends of our dataset. Delaware  has the highest sum of recidivismRate by state , Mississippi has the highest sum of imprisonmentRate by state, Kentucky has lowest  sum of recidivismRate by state, New Mexico got the highest sum of quality go life safety by state, California has the highest sum of quality of life adorability by state. We haven't got any outliers and missing values yet. By the help of power Bi, we have done basis visualization so far. We haven't discuss what visuals needed to be included for final, so it's not final.
