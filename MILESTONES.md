 ### Team Evaluation
 Our team feels that we are working at a good pace to have our dashboard completed by the end of the semester. We have been using our class time to work on brainstorming ideas and obtaining our data. We think that in the future we could have challenges with technical issues. We have already had a few issues using git. We are also unsure of what problems we may face once we start to create our database. When these issues come up we will work together to try and find a solution and will ask for outside help if needed.


 ### Technology Plan
 We are using python for most processes. It will be used for downloading our data and the sqlite3 library will be used to host a database for cleaning and transforming data within the python program. We are planning on using power bi for a dashboard and are still looking into how that could work. From our research so far we think it should be possible to run our python script inside power bi and access the datasets, but we are still looking into the specifics of that process.
