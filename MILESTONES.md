 ### Team Evaluation

 Our team feels that we are working at a good pace to have our dashboard completed by the end of the semester. We have been using our class time to work on brainstorming ideas and obtaining our data. We think that in the future we could have challenges with technical issues. We have already had a few issues using git. We are also unsure of what problems we may face once we start to create our database. When these issues come up we will work together to try and find a solution and will ask for outside help if needed.


 ### Technology Plan

 We are using python for most processes. It will be used for downloading our data and the sqlite3 library will be used to host a database for cleaning and transforming data within the python program. We are planning on using power bi for a dashboard and are still looking into how that could work. From our research so far we think it should be possible to run our python script inside power bi and access the datasets, but we are still looking into the specifics of that process.  


 ### Data Wrangling
 
We are looking the crime data. We have the dataset of Arrests, homicides, and population. We also have the various features related to qualtity of life in each states. We have the dataset recidivism which says what percenatge of prisoner are incarcerated again after being released. We do have prison population and imprisoment rate. So far, we have set database and put the data into the database. We are working on transformation of the dataset. Some of the dataset are found in Json file which we need to convert it into csv file. 


 ### Project Goals
 
 Our project aims to investigate how crime rates and recidivism rates are influenced by various demographic and economic factors. Specifically, we seek to understand the relationship between population size, economic status, quality of life, and crime trends, using census and economic data to identify potential correlations. Our main question is: How are crime rates and recidivism rates affected by other demographic information? The intended audience for this research includes future classes studying crime and sociology, as well as a PSA that could help inform communities and policy makers.

 ### Project Goals

 Our target audience is future data science classes as well as the general public. Our dashboard focuses on factors that affect recidivism which we think can raise awareness to real issues that exist today. This dashboard can be useful for pointing out what problems exist that lead to the high recidivism rates in the US as well as looking at what policies and factors have helped to fix this problem in states with lower recidivism. To communicate our findings and conclusions we will create some charts and models to include in our dashboard that will highlight important points. While doing research we have found other websites with graphs and tables showing similar data to what we might end up with on our dashboard. The kind of questions we want our dashboard to answer involve what different factors can increase and decrease recidivism rates in states. Our main research question is: What factors and policies have negative and positive effects on recidivism rates in the US?

 ### Project Progress

 Our team has been making good progress on achieving our goals for our milestones. Each week we have been planning out our goals for the next Sunday and work on completing them throughout the week. This week we worked on starting our exploratory data analysis. We were able to get Python and Power BI set up on our local machines to start our analysis. Our team has been communicating well. We use our time in class for group discussions about what needs to be done and will communicate outside of class using discord. Moving forward we will start to focus on making models for our data and start to plan out visualizations we want for our dashboard.
